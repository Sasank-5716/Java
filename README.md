# Java Basics 
Welcome to the Java Basics project! This repository is designed to help beginners learn the fundamental concepts of the Java programming language. Whether you are new to programming or transitioning from another language, this guide will provide you with the essential knowledge and practical examples to get started with Java.

## Introduction
Java is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, reliability, and ease of use. This project covers the basics of Java, including syntax, data types, control flow, and object-oriented principles.

## Getting Started
1. Install Java:
Download and install the latest version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).

2. Set Up Your IDE:
You can use any text editor or IDE. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and VS Code.

3. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sasank-5716/Java-Basics
