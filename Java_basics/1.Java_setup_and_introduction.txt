Java Development Kit (JDK):

The JDK is a software development environment used to develop Java applications. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), and other tools.

Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

The JRE provides libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java.

Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

JVM is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run Java programs. It converts bytecode into machine code.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA provide tools to write, compile, debug, and run Java code efficiently.

Step 1: Installing Java JDK
Download the latest JDK from Oracle's official website or use OpenJDK.

Install it on your system and set the environment variable JAVA_HOME (optional but recommended).

Step 2: Setting up an IDE
Download and install Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition.

Create a new Java project.

Step 3: Writing your first Java program
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
Save as HelloWorld.java.

Compile: javac HelloWorld.java

Run: java HelloWorld
